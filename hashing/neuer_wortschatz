Gardevoir is a bipedal, bishoujo-like Pokémon whose body resembles a flowing gown.
Most of its body is white, but its hair, arms, and the underside of its gown are green.
Its hair curls over its face and down the sides of its head.
Behind its red eyes are short spikes, resembling a masquerade mask.
It has long arms with three fingers on each hand and slender white legs.
A red, fin-like horn extends from its chest, and a shorter, more rounded horn extends from the back.
A band of green on its chest extends to the center of the front horn and connects to its sleeve-like arms.
Gardevoir is able to see the future using its psychic powers.
Its telekinetic powers enable it to lift objects and support itself without feeling the pull of gravity.
Additionally, it is able to create small black holes and distort dimensions.
Gardevoir's power reaches its peak when protecting its Trainer, whom it will protect with its life.
This Pokémon typically inhabits urban areas, but has occasionally been sighted in snowy regions.
In Generation IX, Teleport is its signature move.
